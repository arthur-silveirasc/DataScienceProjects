# 50StartupsRegression
A regression problem aimed to predict the profit level of a startup based on a dataset of other 50. We'll use multiple linear, decision tree and random forest regression algorithms
## Getting Started
There are four independent variables (R&D, administrative and marketing spending and home states) and just one dependent (profit). This model is going to be used by venture capitalists, helping them to choose in which startup they'll pour their money. 
### Prerequisites
RStudio 1.1.383 and a few packages (listed in the script).

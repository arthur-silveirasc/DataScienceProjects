# wordcloudTVFestival
A R script aimed to collect Tweets about a brazilian country music festival aired on TV and build a wordcloud based on it.
## Getting Started
"sentimentalAnalysisFesteja.R" is the main script. "cleanTweets.R" is used during the main script
### Prerequisites
RStudio 1.1.383 and a few packages (listed in the script).

For dual core Windows computers, I recommend collecting, at most, 10,000 tweets, to avoid any undesired breaks during the process.

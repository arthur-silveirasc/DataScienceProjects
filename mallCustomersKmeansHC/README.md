# mallCustomersClustering
These R scripts use kmeans and hierarchical clustering to group a mall customers dataset
## Getting Started
The data available brings four key attributes: genre, age, annual income and spending score. We want to cluster these customers by spending score in order to target them with tailored marketing campaigns.
### Prerequisites
RStudio 1.1.383 and a few packages (listed in the script).

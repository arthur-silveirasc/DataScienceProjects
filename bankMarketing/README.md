# bankMarketing
Dataset classification of a Portuguese banking institution, using SVM with Excel. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (y/n) a term deposit
## Getting Started
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns
were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the
product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The "bank-full_vAS_v3" workbook brings the original dataset ("base" worksheet), along with the transformation and the SVM implementation ("transformação" e "tratamento"). The accuracy was 54% and can be improved using another algorithms, such as decision tree and random forest, given the dataset categorical variables. The "UCI Machine Learning Repository_ Bank Marketing Data Set" file helps to understand the dataset and is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

# Statistical Modelling
Here is enlisted four problems - and its resolutions - regarding key topics in statistical modelling, such as Bayes Theorem, hypotheses testing and Naive Bayes classification.
## Getting Started
### Problem #1 (bayesian statistcs):
Three players get into a room and one blue or red hat is placed on the head of each one. The colour of the hat is determined by a throw of a honest coin. No communication between these players is allowed, except a previous strategy alignment before they get into the room. As soon as these players have the chance to look at the hats of the other two, all three have to guess, simultaneously, the colour of their own hats or pass their own turn. The challenge consists in finding a group strategy that maximizes the probability of, at least, one person guessing and no one giving a wrong answer.

A simple strategy could be that the group agrees on a player, previously selected, guessing her own hat and the other two simply passing their turns. Therefore, the probability of at least one person guessing and no one giving a wrong answer equals to 1/2. Suggest a strategy with a larger success probability than the one given and calculate it.

### Problem #2 (bayesian statistcs):
Mary is going to get married tomorrow at a open air ceremony in the desert. In the last years, it has rained only 5 days per year where the ceremony will take place.

Unfortunately, the weather reports predict a rainy day on the big day. It is known that, when it has indeed rained, the weather reports predicted rain in 90% of these cases and, when it hasn't rained, the forecasts gave rain in 10% of these cases. What is the probability that it won't rain on the wedding day?

# Statistical Modelling
Here is enlisted four problems - and its resolutions - regarding key topics in statistical modelling, such as: Bayes Theorem, hypotheses testing and Naive Bayes classification
## Getting Started
### Problem #1 (bayesian statistcs):
Three players get into a room and one blue or red hat is placed on the head of each one. The colour of the hat is determined by a throw of a honest coin. No communication between these players is allowed, except a previous strategy alignment before they get into the room. As soon as these players have the chance to look at the hats of the other two, all three have to guess, simultaneously, the colour of their own hats or pass their own turn. The challenge consists in finding a group strategy that maximizes the probability of, at least, one person guessing and no one giving a wrong answer.

A simple strategy could be that the group agrees on a player, previously selected, guessing her own hat and the other two simply passing their turns. Therefore, the probability of at least one person guessing and no one giving a wrong answer equals to 1/2. Suggest a strategy with a larger success probability than the one given and calculate it.

# Statistical Modelling
Here is enlisted eight problems - and its resolutions - regarding key topics in statistical modelling, such as Bayes Theorem, hypotheses testing and Naive Bayes classifier.
## Getting Started
### Problem 2 (bayesian statistcs):
Mary is going to get married tomorrow at a open air ceremony in the desert. In the last years, it has rained only 5 days per year where the ceremony will take place.

Unfortunately, the weather reports predict a rainy day on the big day. It is known that, when it has indeed rained, the weather reports predicted rain in 90% of these cases and, when it hasn't rained, the forecasts gave rain in 10% of these cases. What is the probability that it won't rain on the wedding day? 

### Problem 4 (hypothesis testing)
A seer says that is capable of guessing the shape of a card without looking at it. You propose the following challenge: in a normal deck of 52 cards, you would draw, at random, 100 cards, one by one, ask the shape to the seer and returning it to the deck. From this experiment, you have to model a hypothesis testing to verify if the seer has the gift that she claims to have. In your test, choose the smaller critical region so that the type I error be less than 5%.
### Problem 5 (basic probability)
With the elements 1,2,...,10 are formed all the sequences (a1,a2,...,a7). Choosing randomly one of these sequences, what is the probability of a chosen sequence not containing repeated elements?
### Problem 6 (basic probability)
From a box containing 10 white balls and 6 black balls, it's selected, at random, k balls. What is the probability of exactly r balls be white, under the 0 <= k - r <= 6 and 0 <= k <= 10 conditions?
